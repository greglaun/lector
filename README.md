# Lector
Lector is an app for learning about things while doing other things. It is GPLv3.

I am developing it in the open primarily out of laziness. I don't expect it to be especially stable or to be a very good source of ideas for how to write Android apps. I'm really just scratching an itch, and doing it slowly during my free time.

The basic idea is it's useful to have "pull" audio content in the sense that you can get audio content for whatever you want to hear about. I'm optimizing for information densite and wide coverage of topics, so for the foreseeable future, I'm focusing on making audio versions of Wikipedia articles.

What sort of madman would want such a thing?? I don't know, but it seems like it might be useful when doing yardwork or on commutes.
