The composable cache API allows the implementation of a chain of API
calls.

* Background and Rationale

Unlike a standard caching system, the goal is not to simply provide
faster access to the same data, but to also allow some modification of the offline data.

* Current design

We have two types of caches. One is a ContextAwareCache that allows storing a context with each
cached response, the other just stores the response.

The context is used as a form of reference counting. E.g., it allows us to know which images and
files were downloaded from article X. That way, when X is deleted from the set of saved articles,
its responses can be cleaned up with it.

The main implementation of ContextAwareCache is SavedArticleCache, which is simply another interface
that exposes a garbage collection method.
